Default Developer Guide
=======================

Start here for a practical end-to-end Flowcept path.

- Repository guide (full markdown):
  `docs/README.md <https://github.com/ORNL/flowcept/blob/main/docs/README.md>`_
- ReadTheDocs sections used by that guide:

  - :doc:`setup`
  - :doc:`prov_capture`
  - :doc:`prov_query`
  - :doc:`rest_api`
  - :doc:`reporting`
  - :doc:`agent`
  - :doc:`telemetry_capture`
  - :doc:`architecture`

What this guide covers
----------------------

- installation and settings as the single source of truth
- capture APIs from simplest to advanced (loops, torch, adapters, agents)
- querying via Python API, REST API, MQ consumers, and offline files
- agentic interaction with external or internal LLM modes
- provenance cards (markdown) and full PDF provenance reports
- architecture links for deeper internals

For software developers, this is the recommended first read before drilling into detailed pages.
